# Census

> Add census authorization to Decidim platform

Allows to upload a census CSV file to perform authorizations against
real users parameterised by their age.

## Usage

This module provides a model `Decidim::Census::Census` to store census information (identity document and birth date).

It has an admin controller to upload CSV files with the information. When importing files all records are inserted and the duplicates are removed in a background job for performance reasons.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'decidim-census'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
bin/rails decidim_census:install:migrations
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Run tests

Create a dummy app in your application (if not present):

```bash
bin/rails decidim:generate_test_app
```

And run tests:

```bash
cd decidim-census
rspec
```
