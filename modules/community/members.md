# Decidim::Members

Members list and search plugin for Decidim.

## Usage

Adding this plugin to your Decidim based Rails app will add a new main menu
entry _Members_ which shows a searchable list of all members.

The plugin depends on a couple of core patches which introduce displayable user
profiles. Those are located in the `extra` directory.


## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'decidim-members'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

$ gem install decidim-members
```
