# Installation (short version) 

We have a nice Decidim installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and macos sierra 10.2

It will create a new Ruby on Rails environment, so if you have any or you're already a RoR developer we recommend that you follow the manual installation instructions.

This script will install rbenv, postgresql, nodejs and install decidim on this directory and it'll take from 15 to 30 minutes depending on your network connection

```
\curl -sSL http://get.decidim.org | bash
